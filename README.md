- I'm a post-doc at Department of Astronomy, Beijing Normal University (BNU).
- I'm interested in applying machine learning techniques on stellar spectroscopy.
- I'm currently working on binary stars.
- You can find some useful repositories in my github page, including
  - [SLAM](https://github.com/hypergravity/astroslam): extracting stellar parameters from spectra using a forward modelling
  - [laspec](https://github.com/hypergravity/laspec): several modules designed for LAMOST spectra
  - [berliner](https://github.com/hypergravity/berliner): some tools on processing stellar tracks and isochrones
  - [regli](https://github.com/hypergravity/regli): a fast, high-dimension linear interpolation tool (faster than the scipy version)
  - [songcn](https://github.com/hypergravity/songcn): a reduction pipeline (of echelle spectra) for the song-china project
- Related projects: 
  - **LAMOST**: 
    a large spectroscopic survey at R~1800/7500
  - **SONG**: 
    a time-domain global observation network with R at 36,000 to 180,000.
