## A self-introduction
- I'm an Assistant Researcher in the CSST Group, NAOC.
- I'm interested in applying machine learning techniques to stellar spectroscopy.
- I was / am working on some projects based on the CSST, LAMOST, SONG-China, etc.
- My packages can be installed via [**this link**](https://github.com/hypergravity/hypergravity/blob/master/my_packages.md).
