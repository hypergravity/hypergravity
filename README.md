## A self-introduction
- I'm a post-doc/**LAMOST Fellow** at Department of Astronomy, Beijing Normal University (BNU).
- I'm interested in applying machine learning techniques to stellar spectroscopy.
- I'm recently working on spectroscopic binary stars in **LAMOST** (R=1,800/7,500).
- I have developed automated pipelines for the **SONG-China** (R=36,000-180,000).
